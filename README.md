## Developer Notes

- API doesn't seem to be taking parameters. So it won't work with you while tring to filter the query, but the code is built already.
- Unfortunately the Unit Tests part of the assignment isn't built as I don't have any real experience with it n couldn't allocate enough time to learn it & execute.
